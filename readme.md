# Introduction
In this repository, I train an XGBoost model to predict whether customers of a fictional telecommunications company will churn. This is uses a [fictional dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ylchang/telco-customer-churn-1113) made by IBM. One of the features, Churn Score, seemed likely to make the problem too easy and unrealistic, so I dropped it fairly early on.
